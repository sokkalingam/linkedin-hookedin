### INTRO: CONTEXT (0:00 - 0:20)
**📹 YOU ON CAMERA - Full screen**

---

LinkedIn is more than a social network—it's a platform. Through developer.linkedin.com, thousands of external developers build apps that integrate with LinkedIn.

They create recruiting tools, analytics dashboards, content schedulers—apps that make LinkedIn more powerful for our members.

And the best way to build real-time integrations? Webhooks. When a member updates their profile or takes an action, webhooks notify these apps instantly.

So naturally, I wanted to help developers build webhook integrations faster.

---

### PART 1: HOOK + PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:50)
**📹 YOU ON CAMERA - Full screen**

---

Hi, I'm [YOUR NAME], and I built HookedIn.

Webhooks are powerful—they enable real-time integrations. But getting a webhook running? That's a different story.

You need infrastructure deployed before you can test. Challenge validation that must work perfectly on the first try. And signature validation with precise cryptographic implementation that isn't well-documented.

The API documentation alone isn't sufficient to get this working easily. I saw an opportunity: what if we could make webhook integration instant with complete working examples?

That's HookedIn.

---

### PART 2: SOLUTION (0:30 - 0:50)
**📹 YOU ON CAMERA - Full screen**

---

HookedIn solves three problems:

One: Instant webhook endpoints—no deployment needed.

Two: Automatic challenge validation—it just works.

Three: Complete signature validation with production-ready code examples.

Let me show you.

### PART 3: DEMO (0:50 - 2:30)
**🖥️ SWITCH TO SCREEN RECORDING**

**[YOU VOICEOVER the screen recording - record this audio over your screen capture]**

---

**[SCREEN: Navigate to HookedIn homepage]**

Here's HookedIn. I'll create a webhook in real-time.

**[SCREEN: Click "Create Webhook"]**

Enter my LinkedIn app credentials...

**[SCREEN: Type client ID and secret]**

And click create.

**[SCREEN: Show webhook URL generated]**

Ten seconds. That's it. I have a production webhook endpoint—public HTTPS, ready to use.

**[SCREEN: Copy the URL]**

Let me configure this in LinkedIn.

**[SCREEN: Switch to LinkedIn Developer Portal]**

Paste the webhook URL...

**[SCREEN: Paste and click verify]**

Click verify. LinkedIn sends a challenge request, HookedIn responds automatically, and we're validated.

**[SCREEN: Show success message]**

Done.

**[SCREEN: Switch back to HookedIn - Manage page]**

Now let's view our events.

**[SCREEN: Enter client ID, retrieve webhooks, click "View Events"]**

Here's the challenge request LinkedIn sent. And here's a real webhook event.

**[SCREEN: Expand an event]**

Notice the green checkmark—signature validated successfully. Beautiful JSON formatting. One-click copy.

**[SCREEN: Click Analytics button]**

HookedIn also provides analytics: event volume over time, validation success rate, health score.

**[SCREEN: Show the charts and metrics]**

Everything you need to monitor webhook health.

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Code Generator]**

And here's the best part: production-ready code generation.

**[SCREEN: Show the generated Node.js code, scroll to signature validation]**

Complete webhook server with correct signature validation. All the implementation details are included with clear comments explaining how it works.

**[SCREEN: Show deployment instructions]**

Includes deployment instructions for Vercel, Railway, Render. Copy, deploy, done.

### PART 4: IMPACT + CLOSE (2:30 - 3:00)
**📹 BACK TO YOU ON CAMERA - Full screen**

---

What normally takes six to ten hours now takes two minutes. That's a ninety-five percent reduction in developer time.

HookedIn provides instant testing, complete code examples, and production-ready generation—making webhook integration accessible to everyone. When we remove friction from the developer experience, amazing integrations happen faster.

Thank you. And let's get HookedIn.

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Making It Feel Natural

**Instead of memorizing, understand:**
- What problem are you solving?
- What's your solution?
- What are you showing in the demo?
- What's the impact?

If you understand these, the exact words matter less.

### Camera Presence

**Look engaged:**
- You're sharing something you built
- You're proud of it
- You're helping people
- This energy should show!

**Avoid:**
- Reading stiffly
- Apologizing ("sorry", "um")
- Looking down or away too much
- Going too fast (nerves!)

### Demo Recording

**Keep it smooth:**
- Slow down 20% from your normal speed
- Let clicks and page loads finish
- Don't backtrack or say "oops"
- If you mess up, start that section over

**Show, don't tell:**
- The visual speaks for itself
- Your narration adds context
- Don't describe every pixel
- Focus on the value

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Talking too fast** - You're on a time limit, but rushing makes it hard to follow
✅ Instead: Speak at normal pace and cut any unnecessary words

❌ **Not practicing** - First take is rarely the best
✅ Instead: Do 3+ run-throughs before hitting record

❌ **Bad audio** - Laptop mic in echoey room
✅ Instead: Use external mic or record in small, soft-furnished room

❌ **Messy screen recording** - Notifications, slow loading, mistakes
✅ Instead: Prepare environment, practice demo, turn off notifications

❌ **Reading word-for-word** - Sounds robotic
✅ Instead: Understand the points, deliver naturally

❌ **Weak energy** - Monotone, low enthusiasm
✅ Instead: You built something cool! Show some excitement!

❌ **Too much technical jargon** - Judges may not be engineers
✅ Instead: Balance technical depth with accessibility
